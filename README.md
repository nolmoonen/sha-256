Hasing and dehashing with the sha-256 algorithm.

Example usage:
* When hashing, entering a string will output its hash. (for example `a` will output `ac231b3 9a23dc4d a786eff8 147c4e72 b9807785 afee48bb`)
* When hashing, entering a hash of 64 characters without spaces will result in the secret. (for example `ca978112ca1bbdcafac231b39a23dc4da786eff8147c4e72b9807785afee48bb` will give `a`)
